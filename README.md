# Module 02 Challenge: My Portfolio using Advanced CSS

<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
<p>
This week's challenge is to create a web application from scratch.  It will be a porfolio page that will showcase my course progression and my individual projects.  This portfolio of work will help employers see my skills and talents so they can determine if I will be a good fit for a part-time or full-time position.  My goal will be to create an effective portfolio that highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.  
</p>


<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
</p>


<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
</p>
<ul>
<li>WHEN I load their portfolio,
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</li>
<li>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</li>
<li>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application,
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the images of the applications,
THEN I am taken to that deployed application</li>
<li>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
